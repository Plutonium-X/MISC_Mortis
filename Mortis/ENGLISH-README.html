</p>
<p align="center">==================================================================================<br />Pack Contents/Description:<br />
  --------------------------<br />
</p>
<p>1- A brand new shop located in area AR1400 (the shadow woods), this shop sells all manner of
  evil items including a set of potions that can turn you into a member of the undead. Lich, Vampire,
  Skeleton Warrior &amp; Wraith are fully playable complete with all standard undead powers &amp; weaknesses (such as inability to use healing potions) These undead potions have a high level
  (often stat also) requirement I will not tell you those limits. find the shop and enjoy
  working it out for yourself.</p>
<p>2- Another semi-shop located in the first level (Irenicus' Dungeon), this shop sells potions that will alter your 
  race to one of the following; Beholder, Gibberling, Gnoll, Goblin, Hobgoblin, Kobold, Lizardman,
Minotaur, Ogre and Orc. </p>
<p>All the changes are in-line with the rules given in the AD&amp;D complete book of humanoids 
  (apart from beholder) They are (in my opinion) a true conversion of the Ad&amp;d races into TDD.<br />
</p>
<p align="center">==================================================================================<br />SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:<br />
  ---------------------.<br />
</p>
<p align="left">To play as any of the new races you MUST start a NEW game as a HUMAN. This is because humans 
  have no racial bonuses for me to need to delete before changing your race.</p>
<p>The undead potions have a high level (&amp; often stat) requirement 
  I will not tell you those limits. find the shop and enjoy working it out for yourself.<br />
</p>
